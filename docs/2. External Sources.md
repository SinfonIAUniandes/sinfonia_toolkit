External Sources.
=======

As per usual in this kind of project, SinfonIA Toolkit is built over external frameworks, languages and tools.
Therefore, it is important to know such tools at least at a basic level to be able to understand a few of our 
design decisions on this project. As a way to aid such comprehension, here is a compilation of external resources
used during the development of this project.

Keep in mind, Even though this list tries to cover as much ground as possible, truth be told, it might not present a complete 
picture on the functioning of such tools. It will most probably be updated over time to reflect the best version of 
such a list we can make.


## C++

First of all, this piece of software is written in the C++ programming language. And as such, is subject to the rules
and conventions that make up its syntax. C++ is a very well established language in the realm of computer science, and
as such, is very well documented under official and non-official sources. 

One of the first places where C++ should be consulted is in the C++ Core Guidelines, proposed and led in philosophy by 
Bjarne Stroustrup, lead creator of the C++ language, it is about as close to an official C++ Guide as it gets.

## ROS

```{warning}

Even though ROS has plenty of versions, a lot of the code is version sensitive and as such, using a different version to the
one currently standardized might cause compatibility issues, as of 2022, the current version is **ROS 20.04 - Noetic Ninjemys**, 
Specifically, the package developed for Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based Linux distros, **the use of this version is highly reccomended, if not even required** 
```

On a higher level than C++, we use the ROS framework, designed for the development and programming of robotics. 
This is an open source framework that informs a lot of the design decisions on how tools communicate with each other. 
ROS is widely documented on an official manner, given that, we believe that most of the really important concepts can be found there.

## Ubuntu

SinfonIA Toolkit is designed to run over Linux, and as mentioned beforehand, an Ubuntu 20.04 install is preferred, this is a relatively widespread distribution
of a Linux-based system, and therefore, one of the best documented ones, however, a deep understanding of the OS is not required to work on this tool and it can
be run either from Bare Metal or through a virtual machine. This OS is completely free, open source and doesn't require any sort of activation.

## ReadtheDocs

Last but not least, this documentation is written on ReadtheDocs' tools for documentation, and hosted on their servers, for further expansion of this
guide, we recommend reading their official documentation on the subject.
