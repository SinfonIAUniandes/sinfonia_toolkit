Main scripts to run ToolKit.
=======

## Bash Scripting. 

In SinfonIA ToolKit we connect to the robot through ROS (Robot Operating System) and for this we need to create some scripts or command sequences which help us to communicate effectively with the Robot and to establish a connection and be able to manipulate it through these tools.

For this we use Bash (Bourne-Again Shell), is a command interpreter and embedded programming language that runs under the Unix Shell macroprocessor. Also known as Linux Shell or Linux Scripting

## Procedure to establish connection with pepper

1. go to the terminal and type the following command:

if your shell is bash use this:
```gedit ~/.bashrc```
elseif your shell is zsh use:
```gedit ~/.zshrc```

then will appear a window with the editable archive for your shell
you can edit this archive with another viewer like nano or vim.
you must type in this archive the following commands:

``` export PEPPER_IP=<PUT PEPPER IP HERE> ```
``` export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://$PEPPER_IP:11311/ ```
``` export ROS_IP=<PUT YOUR LOCAL IP HERE>```

then save and close the shell window

2. go to the terminal and type the following command:

```. . ~/.bashrc```

3. Now to connect to the robot you must type the following command:

```ssh nao@$<PUT_PEPPER_IP_HERE>```

4. Now you must type the password of the robot (default password is nao)

5. Now for sure you are connected to the robot, you should see the following message:

```nao@pepper:~$   ```

6. Now you must type the following command:

```pepper~ ./gentoo/startprefix```

7. Now you must type the following command to start the conexion with ROS:

```pepper~ cd``` 

```pepper~ . startRos.sh```

    if the robot is connected with WiFi wlan
```. start_robot_toolkit_wlan.sh``` 
    but if the robot is connected with Ethernet eth
```. start_robot_toolkit_eth.sh```

8. Try to see the ROS topic, nodes and services with the following command:

```pepper~ rostopic list```
```pepper~ rosnode list```
```pepper~ rosservice list```
