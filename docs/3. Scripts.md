Main scripts to run ToolKit.
=======

## Bash Scripting. 

In SinfonIA ToolKit we connect to the robot through ROS (Robot Operating System) and for this we need to create some scripts or command sequences which help us to communicate effectively with the Robot and to establish a connection and be able to manipulate it through these tools.

For this we use Bash (Bourne-Again Shell), is a command interpreter and embedded programming language that runs under the Unix Shell macroprocessor. Also known as Linux Shell or Linux Scripting

## Procedure to establish connection with pepper

1. go to the terminal and type the following command:

if your shell is bash use this:
```gedit ~/.bashrc```
elseif your shell is zsh use:
```gedit ~/.zshrc```
 
then will appear a window with the editable archive for your shell
you can edit this archive with another viewer like nano or vim.
you must type in this archive the following commands:
